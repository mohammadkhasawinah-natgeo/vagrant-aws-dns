## Usage

### Configuration example

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "dummy"

  config.vm.provider :aws do |aws, override|
    aws.access_key_id = "YOUR KEY"
    aws.secret_access_key = "YOUR SECRET KEY"
    aws.session_token = "SESSION TOKEN"
    aws.keypair_name = "KEYPAIR NAME"

    aws.ami = "ami-7747d01e"

    override.ssh.username = "ubuntu"
    override.ssh.private_key_path = "PATH TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY"
    
    override.dns.record_sets = [%w(HOSTED_ZONE_ID_1 subdomain.domain1.com A 4.3.2.1), %w(HOSTED_ZONE_ID_2 subdomain.domain2.com A)]
  end
```

### record_sets

`record_sets` is an array of record sets that are also represented as arrays. Below are some examples:

* `%w(HOSTED_ZONE_ID subdomain.domain.com A)` - This will set a record of type `subdomain.domain.com. A <public_ip>`, the `<public_ip>` is auto detected.
* `%w(HOSTED_ZONE_ID subdomain.domain.com A 4.3.2.1)` - This will set a record of type `subdomain.domain.com. A 4.3.2.1`.
* `%w(HOSTED_ZONE_ID subdomain.domain.com CNAME domain2.com)` - This will set a record of type `subdomain.domain1.com. CNAME domain2.com.`.

The ip may be omitted in which case the correct ip (private/public) will be chosen based on the type of the HOSTED_ZONE_ID.

## FAQ

* Why this plugin is not named `vagrant-aws-route53` ?

> Unfortunately, that name was already taken by another plugin of the same kind.


* So why develop a new one?
 
> There are several reasons for this: use of new AWS SDK, support of multiple records, support of deleting records on machine halt
  or destroy.
